# charlotte-photo-gallery
A photo gallery for State of Charlotte. This gallery was built from the Pure CSS Photo Gallery: https://github.com/lindsaycarbonell/charlotte-photo-gallery

# How to add a photo to the gallery
In the google spreadsheet, put the case-sensitive name of your photo file WITH the file extension. Put the photo in the assets folder, and it will link up.

# A note on the CSS
A huge chunk of this CSS is an inline stylesheet. Do not move the inline stylesheet, and if you need to make modifications, add them to the bottom of the inline stylesheet.
